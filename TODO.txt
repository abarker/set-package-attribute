Problems with imports on lowest level of tests...

Problems with virtualenv in vim: *need* to be in appropriate virtualenv
to use the p or q shortcut to run program.  Occurs when using pip to install
local packages with 'pip install -e .' -- it can't find the package to import
if not set right.

When you actually import the full package in set_package_attribute it will
execute the __init__.py file for the module... which may not be what you want...
Consider, it could have side-effects, etc.
